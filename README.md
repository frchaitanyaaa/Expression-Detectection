## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Real-time **face detection** and **3D landmark extraction**
- ✅ **Facial expression inference** using MediaPipe’s blendshape scores
- ✅ **Live visualization** of facial landmarks and expression labels on video frames
- ✅ Lightweight and **easy-to-use Python implementation**

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python **3.7 or higher**
- [MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe)
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)

### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/expression-detection-mediapipe.git
cd expression-detection-mediapipe

(Make sure to replace your-username with your GitHub username if uploading this repo)

2. Run the main script:
python expression_detection.py

⚙️ How It Works:
The script captures live video from your webcam.

MediaPipe Face Landmarker processes each frame to:

Detect faces

Extract 3D facial landmarks

Output blendshape scores for various facial movements

These blendshape scores are mapped to common facial expressions like:

Expression Type	Blendshape Example
Happy	Smile blendshape
Surprised	Jaw drop blendshape
Angry	Brow lower blendshape

The detected dominant expression is displayed on the video frame, along with facial landmarks overlayed.

🖼️ Example Output:
✅ Live webcam feed with landmarks drawn over detected faces

✅ Real-time text overlay showing the predicted dominant expression (like "Happy", "Sad", "Surprised")
